# LaTeX Source for "Towards a portable solar/wind replacement for gas generators"

This is a general overview of how to design a solar power system, preferably a portable one. This takes a look at the power density disparities between gas powered generators and solar power systems. It also provides an overview of energy requirements for a few common tools, appliances, and home health needs. It then guides the reader through the calculations and decisions needed in order to build a proper solar power system.

Currently, this is an incomplete draft. Sections are missing, incomplete, or about to be rewritten. If you have knowledge of solar systems and want to contribute, please submit a PR. If you make changes to the LaTeX, please rebuild the PDF file.
